I'm a PhD student in the UChicago CS department.
I'm interested in logic and computing.
I've spent some time thinking about proof complexity and SAT-solvers, but more recently I've been thinking about pure type systems and normalization.

## Other

(10/19/22)
I gave an **informal talk on Girard's paradox** for the [UChicago Theory Lunch](https://orecchia.net/event/theory-lunch/).
I primarily wanted to emphasize why Martin-LÃ¶f might have include the axiom 'Type is a Type' in his type theory despite being fully aware of classical set-theoretic paradoxes. [[slides](pdfs/lunch-slides.pdf)]

I've had the pleasure of teaching **CMSC 10500: Fundamentals of Computer Programming in Swift** for several years now.
In the last few goes, I was able to compile my notes into a GitBook.
The material is loosely based on that of [SICP](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html) and [Composing Programs](http://www.composingprograms.com), two invaluable introductory programming resources.

There are several **proofs of false written in Idris** floating around on the internet, but this one is interesting to me because it's not immediately clear what the problem is.
The proof is in essence the one of Girard's paradox.
I believe the issue stems from the way that universe levels are determined.

I'm pretty sure it's impossible to find a copy of **Turing's original proof that STLC is weakly normalizing** (as published by R.O. Gandy), so I decided to type up a version myself to make available here. [[pdf](pdfs/turing.pdf)]

## And So On

Check my [CV](pdfs/CV.pdf) for contact information and research.
Every once in a while, I write a bit of [poetry](pages/poetry.md).
